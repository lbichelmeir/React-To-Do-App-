To Do App in React

## What I did
I created a To Do app in React following a tutorial by Enlight (https://enlight.nyc/projects/react-to-do-list) and after completing the Scrimba Learn React course (https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

## What I learned:
- Through this tutorial, I developed a better understanding of useState()
- I also used this as an opportunity to continue playing around with the styles to add my own unique 'flair'

## Next Steps
- [X] As a challenge, I will be implementing **local storage** (so that the data persists)

## Work Log
I was able to successfully implement **local storage** on my own! I had some help following the logic from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRDujdtVfJs
